## 📝 Supported PDF Types

## 🔍 What Gets Extracted

The system automatically identifies and extracts:

1. **Name** - Looks for "Name:" or similar labels
2. **Address** - Extracts address information
3. **Case Number** - Finds case numbers, case IDs, etc.

## ⚡ Tips & Tricks

### For Best Results:
- Use clear, text-based PDFs

### If Extraction Doesn't Work Well:

- ✏️ Edit any text content
- 🎨 Change colors and fonts
